# Error showcase

Using redux devtools, there is an error when using a query from the shared
folder.

In the example page, looking at `contributeurs/executeQuery/rejected`, you can
find a TypeError `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')"`

### Disclaimer

This is a sample with my monorepo structure, which may not be standard.

## To run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm devGDF
```
